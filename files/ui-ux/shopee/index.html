                <h3> Overview </h3>
                <p>
                    This was originally part of a project submission for the Shopee Product & Design Challenge 2021. 
                    Participants had about 12 days from the release of the design brief to conceptualize and come up 
                    with ideas to improve the current Shopee app.
                    Now, unconstrained by a deadline and design specifications, I have decided to expand on the ideas 
                    my team came up with (and of course, put it up here as part of my portfolioüòÅ)!
                </p>

                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                <p>
                    Launched in 2015, Shopee has grown to become one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Southeast 
                    Asia and Taiwan. It boasts a wide selection of products, and offers an easy, secure, and fast 
                    online shopping experience for consumers (or at least that‚Äôs what Shopee says on their website).
                </p>

                <h3> User Research </h3>
                <p>
                    To gain a deeper understanding of user needs, my team administered a survey to a sample size of 
                    <b>39 respondents</b>, asking questions relating to their usage of e-commerce applications. 
                    Our sample focuses on Shopee‚Äôs target user group, mostly consisting of young adults in the 
                    <b>21-30 years old</b> range.

                    <ul> The survey sought to:
                        <li> understand the average user behaviour and interactions with the Shopee app; </li>
                        <li> find out why users might (or might not) prefer the Shopee app over other major e-commerce competitors (such as Lazada and AliExpress); </li>
                        <li> identify common user pain points. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We discovered most survey respondents to be casual browsers, spending on average less than 
                    30 minutes on the app each time.<br>


                    Some of the reasons cited for using Shopee include: 
                    convenience, low prices, and abundance of good deals. 
                    However, users also identified a few issues they were frustrated with: namely, the 
                    lack of reviews for products, lack of ratings for sellers, and a cluttered app interface.
                </p>
