                <h3> Overview </h3>
                <p>
                    This is a student project submission for my <a href="https://nusmods.com/modules/NM3221/mobile-interaction-design" target="_blank">NM3221 Mobile Interaction Design</a> module.
                </p>

                <h3> Design Brief </h3>
                <p>
                    Do a case-study analysis of an existing mobile/web asset, taking into account the stakeholders involved, 
                    surveying of user opinions on the current design being used, and proposing a <b>re-design on a specific pain point</b> 
                    that improves on issues that the current mobile/web asset has. 
                </p>

                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                <p>
                    DBS PayLah! was first introduced in 2014, admist the drive towards cashless payment in Singapore as part of the Smart Nation Initiative. 
                    Today, digital wallets are the second-most popular payment method in Singapore, with many competitors in the market such as FavePay, GrabPay and Google Pay. 
                    Reports have also shown that usage of digital wallets in e-commerce is expected to rise exponentially in the coming years.
                </p>

                <h3> User Research </h3>
                <p>
                    To gain a deeper understanding of user needs, my team administered a survey to a sample size of 
                    <b>39 respondents</b>, asking questions relating to their usage of e-commerce applications. 
                    Our sample focuses on Shopee’s target user group, mostly consisting of young adults in the 
                    <b>21-30 years old</b> range.

                    <ul> The survey sought to:
                        <li> understand the average user behaviour and interactions with the Shopee app; </li>
                        <li> find out why users might (or might not) prefer the Shopee app over other major e-commerce competitors (such as Lazada and AliExpress); </li>
                        <li> identify common user pain points. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="images/Shopee-Time.JPG" alt="average app browsing time">
                    We discovered most survey respondents to be casual browsers, spending on average less than 
                    30 minutes on the app each time.<br>

                    <img src="images/Shopee-Issues.JPG" alt="shopee ux issues">
                    Some of the reasons cited for using Shopee include: 
                    <br> &#128077; convenience, low prices, and abundance of good deals. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, users also identified a few issues they were frustrated with, namely:
                    <br> &#x1F44E; lack of reviews for products, lack of ratings for sellers, and a cluttered app interface.
                </p>

                <h3> User Persona </h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the key findings gathered from our user research, I created 2 personas depicting a user’s 
                    behaviour and pain-points when using the app.
                    <img src="images/PersonaOne.png" alt="persona one">
                    <img src="images/PersonaTwo.png" alt="persona two">
                </p>
                
                <h3> Problem Definition </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Overly cluttered  homepage </li>
                    <li> Excessive ad banners interfering with browsing experience </li>
                    <li> Too many different features and sections with no clear distinctions between them </li>
                    <li> Lack of product ratings and seller feedback </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These pain points contribute to cognitive overload when a user first arrives at the homepage, 
                    overcomplicates the browsing process, and makes it harder for the user to make a purchase decision 
                    due to insufficient product reviews.                    
                </p>

                <h3> Proposed Improvements </h3>
                <ol>
                  <li> A more personalized homepage containing only the most important features and listings </li>
                  <li> Strategically placed banners and pop-ups that do not overly intrude on a user’s browsing experience </li>
                  <li> More user-friendly layout and neater categorization of features overall </li>
                  <li> Rework reminder for users to leave product ratings and seller reviews </li>
                </ol>

                <h3> Lo-fi Design Mock-ups </h3>
                <p> After gaining a deeper understanding of common pain points and user needs, we fleshed
                  out key design features to include and possible ways to incorporate them.
                </p>
                <p> Here are some lo-fi mock-ups sketched by one of my teammates! </p>

                <h3> High Fidelity Prototyping </h3>
                <p> Armed with all of our research and brainstormed ideas, we then moved on to design a high fidelity 
                    version of our prototype on Figma. </p>
