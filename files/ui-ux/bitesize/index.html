                <h3> Overview </h3>
                <p>
                    BiteSize is a dietary tracking and planning app specially catered for local diets, made as a student project submission 
                    for the <a href="https://nusmods.com/modules/NM3221/mobile-interaction-design" target="_blank">NM3221 Mobile Interaction Design</a> module.
                </p>

                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                <p>
                    According to the Global Nutrition Report, Singapore has shown limited progress towards achieving its diet-related non-communicable disease (NCD) 
                    targets. Over the years, the Singapore government has spared no effort in initiating new campaigns to encourage Singaporeans to cultivate healthy 
                    eating habits, such as by declaring a War on Diabetes, or by hosting the Eat, Drink Shop Healthy Challenge. 
                    While there has been an uptick in the number of Singaporeans who have since adopted healthier eating habits, much remains to be done. 
                </p>

                <!-- <h3> Datasources </h3>
                <ol> 
                    To ensure that this is a relevant problem space to tackle at all, I utilized datasets from several sources to inform my approach. 
                    Most notably, I aggregated information from: 

                    <li> 
                        <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/" target="_blank">HealthHub</a>, 
                        a one-stop web portal initiated by the Ministry of Health for Singaporeans to access a wide range of health-related content; 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <a href="https://data.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Data.gov.sg</a> , 
                        a publicly available government data repository – specifically, looking at datasets for healthier choice products, healthier eateries, and healthier caterers;
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        the <a href="https://www.hpb.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Health Promotion Board (HPB)</a> website, 
                        which is under a credible government organization that aims to promote healthy living in Singapore; and
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        the <a href="https://globalnutritionreport.org/resources/nutrition-profiles/asia/south-eastern-asia/singapore/" target="_blank">Global Nutrition Report</a>, 
                        which provides Country Nutrition Profiles tracking progress made by countries towards global nutrition targets set by the World Health Assembly.
                    </li>
                </ol> -->
                
                <h3> Problem Space </h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Diabetes</b><br>
                    Over 400,000 people were revealed to have diabetes in Singapore during the 2016 Committee of Supply debates in Parliament (HealthHub, 2021). 
                    One in three were not aware that they had the disease, while for those who were aware, one third had poor control of it. 
                    It is projected that nearly one million people in Singapore will have diabetes by 2050 if the issue is left unaddressed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Obesity</b><br>
                    The prevalence of obesity has been on the rise for children and adults, both males and females, in Singapore. 
                    The 2017 National Population Health Survey found that the prevalence of obesity among adult Singaporeans (aged 18 to 59 years) was 8.9%, 
                    and that among seniors (aged 60 to 74 years) was 6.9%. Meanwhile, 13% of children (aged 6 to 18 years) are considered obese, 
                    signifying an increase from the 11% in 2013.  

                    <img src="images/data/obese-adults.JPG" alt="obesity trend for adults in Singapore">
                    <figcaption> Image from the <a href="https://globalnutritionreport.org/resources/nutrition-profiles/asia/south-eastern-asia/singapore/" target="_blank">Global Nutrition Report on Singapore</a> </figcaption>
                </p>    
                <p>
                    This presents a pressing problem space to address, which BiteSize aims to help tackle.
                </p>
                    

                <h3> Research Design </h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Preliminary Research</b><br>
                    I first sought to understand the current app options available in the market and identify some potential areas of 
                    improvement in existing apps. Currently, the most widely used app to track healthy eating both globally and in Singapore is MyFitnessPal. 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    To find out general user sentiments on MyFitnessPal, I first looked at reviews on the Google Play Store. Some pain points identified include:
                    <li>
                        the user interface is <b>cluttered with random advertisements</b>, making for a very unpleasant user experience. 
                        One of the first things users see when they open up the app is a large advertisement, rather than relevant information such as their 
                        nutritional intake information or progression towards their health goals.
                    </li>
                    <img src="images/MFP/ads.png" alt="negative reviews for My Fitness Pal">
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        the interface is also very <b>information dense</b>, which can be intimidating for new users who are unfamiliar with certain terminology, 
                        leading them to feel overwhelmed by all the features and information available. 
                        <img class="item-images-small" src="images/MFP/mfp-ui.png" alt="Cluttered UI for My Fitness Pal">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Furthermore, MyFitnessPal is <b>not designed to specifically cater for local diets</b> nor is it targeted at local users, which can lead to inaccurate nutritional tracking. 
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Following the preliminary research conducted, I proceeded with primary research where I identified a target user group and find out more specific information on use cases.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Primary Research</b><br>
                    Target Users: Singaporeans who are conscious about their eating habits and wish to pursue a healthier lifestyle. <br><br>
                    I employed semi-structured interviews to gather insights into my broader research goals, which was split into 2 main sections: 
                    (i) interviewee demographics and (ii) healthy eating habits and usage of relevant applications. 
                    <br><br>
                    3 interviewees covering a broad range of demographics were selected. 
                    They ranged from ages 18 to 56, with males and females who are currently undergoing different stages in life (schooling and working) in order to cover 
                    as wide a range of scenarios as possible. The interview answers were recorded and then organized into various sticky notes for thematic analysis.
                    
                    <img src="images/data/NM3221 Individual Project - Frame 1.jpg" alt="Health consciousness">
                    <p class="highlight-box">
                    <b>Insight 1:</b> Younger interviewees (blue and pink) acknowledged that healthy eating is important, but stated that they do not really commit to 
                    making healthy lifestyle choices. Conversely, the older interviewee (yellow) is more conscious about available food choices and healthier alternatives.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <img src="images/data/NM3221 Individual Project - Frame 2.jpg" alt="Health consciousness">
                    <p class="highlight-box">
                    <b>Insight 2:</b> Younger interviewees (blue and pink) do not really use health-related apps, citing “laziness” or a lack of discipline to commit to regular usage. 
                    Meanwhile, the older interviewee (yellow) uses health-related apps such as Healthy 365 regularly in relation to shopping for healthier-choice groceries, 
                    and other similar apps that provide incentives for engaging in health-related activities. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Extrapolating from the interview findings, Singaporeans may place different degrees of importance on healthy eating/lifestyle depending on their age 
                    and stage in life. While older Singaporeans may be more incentivized to make lifestyle choices that are good for their health, younger Singaporeans 
                    may prioritize convenience instead.  
                    </p>
                    
                </p>

                <h3> Problem Statements </h3>
                <p>
                    These interview insights can be summarised in the following problem statements:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Health-conscious Singaporeans need an easy and convenient way to log their food so that they can track of their nutritional intake more 
                            consistently and accurately.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Health-conscious Singaporeans need an easy way to prepare healthy and delicious food according to their dietary needs because they want to 
                            maintain good health over the long run.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h3> User Personas </h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the different interviewee profiles and pain points raised, I created 2 user personas to better represent the different sets of pain points that are likely 
                    to be faced by users from 2 different age groups (younger versus older Singaporeans). 
                </p>

                <h3> Introducing BiteSize </h3>
                <p>
                    Designed specifically for users based in Singapore, BiteSize will incorporate nutritional guidelines and food composition data by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) to 
                    recommend suitable dietary plans in a fun and engaging manner. The app will feature a robust dataset of nutritional information for popular dishes found in Singapore, 
                    and incorporate data on healthier eateries, caterers, and food choices based on the publicly available data at Data.gov.sg. Most importantly, Bitesize will prioritize 
                    convenience and ease of use when it comes to food logging and preparation of healthy meals for beginners. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We conducted <b>5 semi-structured interviews</b> asking a series of questions relating to our research goals, adding necessary prompts where needed. 
                </p>

                <h3> User Personas </h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the key findings gathered from our user research, we created 2 personas depicting a user’s 
                    behaviour and pain-points when using the app.

                </ol>
                <p>
                    These pain points contribute to cognitive overload when a user first arrives at the homepage, 
                    overcomplicates the browsing process, and makes it harder for the user to make a purchase decision 
                    due to insufficient product reviews.                    
                </p>

                <h3> Proposed Improvements </h3>
                <ol>
                  <li> A more personalized homepage containing only the most important features and listings </li>
                  <li> Strategically placed banners and pop-ups that do not overly intrude on a user’s browsing experience </li>
                  <li> More user-friendly layout and neater categorization of features overall </li>
                  <li> Rework reminder for users to leave product ratings and seller reviews </li>
