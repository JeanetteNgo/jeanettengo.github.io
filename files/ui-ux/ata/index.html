                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                <p>
                    Aureus Trial Adventure (ATA) is a digitalisation project that seeks to transform the classroom experience for trial music lessons. 
                    Instead of using physical activity booklets, teachers can now utilize the ATA app to conduct their lessons. 
                    <br><br>
                    The target audience: young students aged 3-6 years old whose parents have signed them up for a trial music lesson with Aureus.
                    The objective of this digitalisation project is to streamline the classroom trial experience, both for the teachers conducting the lesson, and the students engaging with it.
                    <br><br>                
                    v1.0.0 was designed and developed over the course of mid-February to March 2023, and released in April 2023. This version is a minimum viable product featuring a basic set of layouts and flows for 6 instruments.
                </p>

                <h3> My Role </h3>
                <ul>
                    As the lead designer, I:
                    <li>
                        Worked collaboratively with directors and developers to ideate and iterate on designs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created functioning prototypes for product demos
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Managed and consolidated graphic assets across team functions, resulting in a more streamlined content uploading process
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Took charge of design QA by reporting any discrepancies between what was built versus what was designed
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <hr>

                <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Process</h3>
                <p>
                    To kickstart the process, we invited a training manager to walk us through the current classoom experience to gain a deeper understanding.
                </p>

                <div class="item-images-small">
                    <img src="images/walkthrough.png" alt="walkthrough">
                </div>                  
                
                <p>
                    We discovered that in a single trial lesson, teachers have to switch between multiple mediums such as videos, printed booklets, and external websites.
                </p>

                

                <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Ideation </h3>
                <p>
                    Since we are building upon an existing product, the process was a lot more simplified. I initiated a QnA with the trainers, collaborated with other designers to come up with a storyboard, and finalised the flows and requirements.
                </p>
                
                <div class="item-images-grid">
                    <img src="images/storyboard.png" alt="storyboard">
                    <img src="images/flowchart.png" alt="flowchart">
                </div>



                <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Design & Development </h3>
                <p>
                    Given the short timeline, we optimised the build process by constraining the designs to a set of 7 reusable layouts to facilitate the ease of development and content management.
                </p>


                <h4> Activity Introduction </h4> 
                <p>
                    The info bottom layout appears at the start of every milestone activity, and features a different character at each milestone to introduce the upcoming activity to the student.
                </p> <br>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <!-- <img src="images/layout-info-bottom.png" alt="info bottom layout"> -->
                    <video controls autoplay loop muted>
                        <source src="images/layout-infobottom-2.mov" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div> 

                <br>

                <h4> Teaching with Carousels </h4> 
                <p>
                    We needed a fun way to display a series of informational or instructional screens, and that's where the "carousel" layout comes into play.
                    <br><br>
                    The carousel layout is distinguished by its left and right arrows, which students can use to navigate to the previous or next in sequence in a series of related screens.
                    This breaks up the monotony of having to tap on the 'Next' button multiple times in a row whenever instructional screens <i>(which young students usually associate with the word "boring"!)</i> come up.
                </p> <br>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <!-- <img src="images/layout-carousel.png" alt="carousel layout"> -->
                    <video controls autoplay loop muted>
                        <source src="images/layout-carousel.mov" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div> 

                <br>

                <h4> Engaging with Audio </h4> 
                <p>
                    Being one of SG's leading music schools, Aureus places great importance on creating immersive and engaging music experiences.
                    The "audio card" layout features a few of our characters in their natural habitats, along with sounds that the students have to identity upon tapping on each card. 
                </p> <br>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <img src="images/layout-audiocard.png" alt="audio card layout">
                </div>  

                <br>
                
                <h4> Learning with Videos </h4> 
                <p>
                    What good is theory without practice? After going through the necessary know-hows, students are given the chance to hone their practical skills by picking a song of their choice to play along. 
                </p> <br>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <video controls autoplay loop>
                        <source src="images/layout-videoplayer.mov" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div> 

                <br>

                <h4> "Great Job" Pop-ups </h4> 
                <p>
                    A little encouragement goes a long way. The popup layout is used for congratulatory messages that appear upon completion of a milestone activity. 
                    On top of providing segmentation in the flow, serving as an indicator that the current stage has ended and the next stage is about to begin, these pop-ups invoke in students a sense of achievement and fullfilment.
                </p> <br>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <!-- <img src="images/layout-popup.png" alt="popup layout"> -->
                    <video controls autoplay loop muted>
                        <source src="images/layout-popup.mov" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div> 

                <br>

                <h4> Report Card </h4> 
                <p>
                    At the end of their journey, teachers can evaluate the student based on their performance in various categories. 
                    A report card will be generated for each student as a keepsake of their experience with Aureus. 
                </p> <br>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <video controls autoplay loop muted>
                        <source src="images/evaluation-report.mov" type="video/mp4">
                    </video>
                </div> 



                <hr>

                <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;"> Concluding Thoughts </h3>
                <p>
                    Using a combination of various mediums, the team was able to experiment and create an engaging musical experience for young students dipping their toes into music for the first time.
                    <br><br>
                    The project concluded as a successful trial run with positive engagement and feedback from teachers, students and parents. This kickstarted plans to expand on the project to encompass not just trial classes, but also normal classes at Aureus Academy.
