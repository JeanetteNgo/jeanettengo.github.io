                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                <p>
                    Aureus Trial Adventure (ATA) is a digitalisation project that seeks to transform the classroom experience for trial music lessons. 
                    Instead of using physical activity booklets, teachers can now utilize the ATA app to conduct their lessons. 
                    <br><br>
                    The target audience: young students aged 3-6 years old whose parents have signed them up for a trial music lesson with Aureus.
                    The objective of this digitalisation project is to streamline the classroom trial experience, both for the teachers conducting the lesson, and the students engaging with it.
                    <br><br>                
                    v1.0.0 was designed and developed over the course of mid-February to March 2023, and released in April 2023. This version is a minimum viable product featuring a basic set of layouts and flows for 6 instruments.
                </p>

                <h3> My Role </h3>
                <ul>
                    As the lead designer, I:
                    <li>
                        Worked collaboratively with directors and developers to ideate and iterate on designs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created functioning prototypes for product demos
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Managed and consolidated graphic assets across team functions, resulting in a more streamlined content uploading process
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <hr>

                <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Process</h3>
                <p>
                    To kickstart the process, we invited a training manager to walk us through the current classoom experience to gain a deeper understanding.
                </p>

                <div class="item-images-small">
                    <img src="images/walkthrough.png" alt="walkthrough">
                </div>                  
                
                <p>
                    We discovered that in a single trial lesson, teachers have to switch between multiple mediums such as videos, printed booklets, and external websites.
                </p>

                

                <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Ideation </h3>
                <p>
                    Since we are building upon an existing product, the process was a lot more simplified. I initiated a QnA with the trainers, collaborated with other designers to come up with a storyboard, and finalised the flows and requirements.
                </p>
                
                <div class="item-images-grid">

                    <img src="images/flowchart.png" alt="flowchart">
                </div>



                <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Design & Development </h3>
                <p>
                    Given the short timeline, we optimised the build process by constraining the designs to a set of 7 reusable layouts to facilitate the ease of development and content management.
                </p>

                <h4> Audio card </h4> 
                <p>
                    The audio card layout features the characters in their natural habitat, along with sounds that the students have to identity. In v1.0.0, the design can only accomodate for a maximum of 3 characters - this can be further enhanced down the line.
                </p>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <img src="images/layout-audiocard.png" alt="audio card layout">
                </div>  

                <h4> Media full </h4> 
                <p>
                    The media full layout is used for full screen assets, including videos, images and animations.
                </p>
                <div class="item-images-grid">
                    <img src="images/layout-media-full.png" alt="media full layout">
                    <img src="images/layout-video.png" alt="video player layout">
                </div>

                <h4> Info Bottom </h4> 
                <p>
                    The info bottom layout appears at the start of every milestone activity, and features a different character at each milestone to introduce the upcoming activity to the student.
                </p>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <img src="images/layout-info-bottom.png" alt="info bottom layout">
                </div> 

                <h4> Carousel </h4> 
                <p>
                    The carousel layout is used to display multiple instances of a related sequence, such as instructional screens and bonus questions. Users can use the left and right arrow buttons to navigate to the previous or next in sequence.
                </p>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <img src="images/layout-carousel.png" alt="carousel layout">
                </div> 

                <h4> Action and Decision cards </h4> 
                <p>
                    The action card layout is used when users have to make a choice between different options, such as when it comes to selecting a song to play. The graphic asset for each action card should be 16:9 in aspect ratio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The decision card layout is used when users have to make a choice between different options that lead to different “paths”. An example is choosing between proceeding to the bonus stage, or skipping it and heading to the evaluation screen. The graphic asset for each decision card should be 1:1 in aspect ratio.
                </p>
                <div class="item-images-grid">
                    <img src="images/layout-action-card.png" alt="action card layout">
                    <img src="images/layout-decision-card.png" alt="decision card layout">
                </div>

                <h4> Pop-up </h4> 
                <p>
                    The popup layout is used for congratulatory messages that appear upon completion of a milestone activity. This is important to provide some form of segmentation in the flow, serving as an indicator that the current stage has ended and the next stage is about to begin.
                </p>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <img src="images/layout-popup.png" alt="popup layout">
                </div>

                <h3 style="padding-top: 50px;"> Concluding Thoughts </h3>
                <p>
                    The project concluded as a successful trial run with positive engagement and feedback from teachers, students and parents. This kickstarted plans to expand on the project to encompass not just trial classes, but also normal classes.
