                <h3> Overview </h3>
                <p>
                    This was originally part of a project submission for the 
                    <a href="https://careers.shopee.sg/productdesign2021/" target="_blank">Shopee Product & Design Challenge 2021</a>. 
                    Participants had about 12 days from the release of the design brief to conceptualize and come up 
                    with ideas to improve the current Shopee app.
                    Now, unconstrained by a deadline and design specifications, I have decided to expand on the ideas my team came up with,
                    but you can check out our original submission on  
                    <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/110793045/Shopee-Product-Development-Challenge-2021" target="_blank"> 
                    Behance</a>! &#129321;
                </p>

                <h3> Introduction </h3>
                <p>
                    Launched in 2015, Shopee has grown to become one of the leading e-commerce platforms in Southeast 
                    Asia and Taiwan. It boasts a wide selection of products, and offers an easy, secure, and fast 
                    online shopping experience for consumers.
                </p>

                <h3> User Research </h3>
                <p>
                    To gain a deeper understanding of user needs, my team administered a survey to a sample size of 
                    <b>39 respondents</b>, asking questions relating to their usage of e-commerce applications. 
                    Our sample focuses on Shopee’s target user group, mostly consisting of young adults in the 
                    <b>21-30 years old</b> range.

                    <ul> The survey sought to:
                        <li> understand the average user behaviour and interactions with the Shopee app; </li>
                        <li> find out why users might (or might not) prefer the Shopee app over other major e-commerce competitors (such as Lazada and AliExpress); </li>
                        <li> identify common user pain points. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <img src="images/Shopee-Time.JPG" alt="average app browsing time">
                    We discovered most survey respondents to be casual browsers, spending on average less than 
                    30 minutes on the app each time.<br>

                    <img src="images/Shopee-Issues.JPG" alt="shopee ux issues">
                    Some of the reasons cited for using Shopee include: 
                    convenience, low prices, and abundance of good deals. 
                    However, users also identified a few issues they were frustrated with: namely, the 
                    lack of reviews for products, lack of ratings for sellers, and a cluttered app interface.
                </p>

                <h3> User Persona </h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the key findings gathered from our user research, I created 2 personas depicting a user’s 
                    behaviour and pain-points when using the app.
                    <img src="images/PersonaOne.png" alt="persona one">
                    <img src="images/PersonaTwo.png" alt="persona two">
                </p>
                
                <h3> Problem Definition </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Overly cluttered  homepage </li>
                    <li> Excessive ad banners interfering with browsing experience </li>
                    <li> Too many different features and sections with no clear distinctions between them </li>
                    <li> Lack of product ratings and seller feedback </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These pain points contribute to cognitive overload when a user first arrives at the homepage, 
                    overcomplicates the browsing process, and makes it harder for the user to make a purchase decision 
                    due to insufficient product reviews.                    
                </p>

                <h3> Proposed Improvements </h3>
                <ol>
                  <li> A more personalized homepage containing only the most important features and listings </li>
                  <li> Strategically placed banners and pop-ups that do not overly intrude on a user’s browsing experience </li>
                  <li> More user-friendly layout and neater categorization of features overall </li>
                  <li> Rework reminder for users to leave product ratings and seller reviews </li>
                </ol>

                <h3> Lo-fi Design Mock-ups </h3>
                <p> After gaining a deeper understanding of common pain points and user needs, we fleshed
                  out key design features to include and possible ways to incorporate them.
                </p>
                <p> Here are some lo-fi mock-ups sketched by one of my teammates! </p>
                <div class="item-images-wide">
                    <img src="images/lo-fi-mockup.JPG" alt="lofi mock-up">
                </div>

                <h3> High Fidelity Prototyping </h3>
                <p> Armed with all of our research and brainstormed ideas, we then moved on to design a high fidelity 
                    version of our prototype on Figma. </p>

                <!-- Improved user screens -->
                <h4> Home Screen & Pop-up feature </h4>
                <div class="img-row">
                    <div class="img-column">
                    <img src="images/final-screens/home-screen.jpg" alt="Homescreen" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="img-column">
                    <img src="images/final-screens/home-screen-discover.jpg" alt="Homescreen-discover" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="img-column">
                    <img src="images/final-screens/home-screen-overlay.jpg" alt="Homescreen-overlay" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The original homescreen felt overly cluttered with advertisements, multiple quick access tabs, 
                    and was inundated with various item listings hailing from different segments such as: 
                    "Fresh Deals Daily, "Flash Deals", "Top Products", "Shopee Mall", "Dining & Services", 
                    "Trending Searches", "Featured Collections", "Categories", and "Daily Discover" &#8592; Yeah that was hard to digest
                    <br><br>
                    In my design, I decided to retain only select segments which I thought were relevant and 
                    belonged to the main feed, such as a consolidated section for banner ads, shopeepay wallet and 
                    coins preview, quick access tabs, "Flash Deals" and "Daily Discover".
                    <br><br>
                    A new function proposed here is the pop-up overlay, which would allow the user to conveniently view 
                    key details about a product such as product photos, name, price, rating and number sold, as well as seller ratings, 
                    and to easily favourite or add the product to cart. According to our research data, these factors play a prominent 
                    role in determining whether a user ends up purchasing a product. Thus, providing users the option to quickly 
                    browse products they fancy, acquire relevant details, and add them to cart could potentially drive up sales.
                </p>

                <h4> Search </h4>
                <div class="img-row">
                    <div class="img-column">
                    <img src="images/final-screens/search-trending.jpg" alt="Trending searches" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    New search interface allows users to easily search previously "liked" items.
                </p>

                <h4> Categories</h4>
                <div class="img-row">
                    <div class="img-column">
                    <img src="images/final-screens/categories.jpg" alt="Categories" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="img-column">
                    <img src="images/final-screens/categories-apparel.jpg" alt="Apparels" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The original categories section was inconspicuous and hard to access, being buried amongst other sections 
                    in the home page, requiring users to scroll several times to access it. 
                    <br><br>
                    The new design introduces a dedicated categories section that is comparatively more visible and 
                    easily accessible via the top left corner of the homescreen.
                </p>

                <h4> Notifications </h4>
                <div class="img-row">

                    <div class="img-column">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    A more streamlined notification channel, combining the previously separate chat and notifications icons.
                </p>

                <h4> Entertainment </h4>
                <div class="img-row">
                    <div class="img-column">
                    <img src="images/final-screens/entertainment-games.jpg" alt="Shopee Games" style="width:100%">

                    </div>
                    <div class="img-column">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Better categorization and accessibility by incorporating Shopee Games, Shopee Feed and Shopee Live into a single
                    "Entertainment" tab.
                </p>

                <h4> Shopee Mall </h4>
                <div class="img-row">
                    <div class="img-column">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Clearer distinction between Shopee Mall and other Shopee items, for those confused on what Shopee Mall is.
                </p>
